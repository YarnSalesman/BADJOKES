BADJOKES is a collection of my vain attempts at programming, in C, your desktop 
icons and the Windows GDI.

ICONDANCE and BLASTBTN are not my creations but were reverse engineered to a 
reasonable degree of accuracy (Delphi -> C). They were the main inspiration for 
this repository. You can see them in action here:

All other programs have been tested on Windows 10, 8.1, and 7. Each is meant to
run indefinitely until you press the ESCAPE key.
